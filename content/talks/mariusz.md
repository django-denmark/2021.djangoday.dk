The migration framework is in Django since version 1.7, it's been 7 year now,
however it still has powerful abilities that are not widely used and well known.

This talk will discuss how we can use migrations' secret powers in response to
changing business requirements, and how create less complicated, more robust,
and requiring less downtime migrations.
